# 🧪 C++ Experiment 4: Bitwise Operators and Bit Manipulation

## 🎯 Aim

To:
- Understand how bitwise operators work in C++
- Learn how to set (turn ON) and reset (turn OFF) specific bits in a number

---

## ✅ Objectives

🔹 Use basic bitwise operators like `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`  
🔹 Learn how to change just one bit in a number  
🔹 Understand how shifting bits left or right changes the whole value

## 📘 Theory

### What Are Bitwise Operators?

Every number is made of bits (`0`s and `1`s). Bitwise operators let us control specific bits directly — useful in areas like controlling LEDs, sensors, switches, flags, etc.

### Common Bitwise Operators in C++

| Operator     | Symbol | Description                                        |
|--------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------|
| AND          | `&`    | Sets bit to 1 only if both bits are 1              |
| OR           | `\|`   | Sets bit to 1 if at least one bit is 1             |
| XOR          | `^`    | Sets bit to 1 if only one of the bits is 1         |
| NOT          | `~`    | Inverts all bits (0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0)        |
| Left Shift   | `<<`   | Shifts bits to the left, multiplies by 2           |
| Right Shift  | `>>`   | Shifts bits to the right, divides by 2             |

## 🛠 Set and Reset a Bit

Sometimes, we want to change just **one specific bit** in a number.

### To Set a Bit
```num | (1 << 3)```
This keeps all other bits the same, and turns bit at position 3 to 1

# To Reset a Bit (Make a bit = 0)
```num & (~(1 << 4))```
This makes the bit at position 4 = 0, and keeps the rest unchanged.

# Program Description

Bitwise Operations
Take two numbers (say a = 5 and b = 3)

Apply each bitwise operator and show the result

a & b → AND

a | b → OR

a ^ b → XOR

~a → NOT

a << 1 → Left shift by 1

a >> 1 → Right shift by 1

# Set & Reset Specific Bits

Let’s say we want to set bit 2 of number a → use a | (1 << 2)

To resetF bit 1 of number a → use a & (~(1 << 1))

We can see that before and after values has changed just one bit.

# Concepts Used

Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>

Set a bit: num | (1 << position)

Reset a bit: num & (~(1 << position))

# Sample Output


Bitwise Operators
```AND: 0
OR: 14
XOR: 14
NOT: -13
LEFT_SHIFT: 48
RIGHT_SHIFT: 1
```
Set-Reset Operation
```Enter bit to set: 3
Enter bit to reset: 4
SET OUTPUT: 88
RESET OUTPUT: 64
