Bitwise operators in C++ perform operations directly on the binary representations of integers. These include AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), left shift (<<), and right shift (>>). They are commonly used in low-level programming, such as embedded systems or performance-critical applications. Bitwise operations are fast and efficient for manipulating individual bits.
